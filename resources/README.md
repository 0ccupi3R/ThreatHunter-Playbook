| Finding Cyber Threats With ATT&CK-Based Analytics | This paper presents a methodology for using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a behavioral-based threat model, to identify relevant defensive sensors and build, test, and refine behavioral-based analytic detection capabilities using adversary emulation | [@MITREattack](https://twitter.com/MITREattack) | [paper](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook/blob/master/resources/papers/16-3713-finding-cyber-threats%20with%20att%26ck-based-analytics.pdf) | 
| Advanced Threat Detection And Response | Using Splunk software to defend against advanced threats  | [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) | [Paper](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook/blob/master/resources/papers/advanced-threat-detection-and-response-tech-brief.pdf) |
| Network Profiling Using Flow | This report provides a step-by-step guide for profiling—discovering public-facing assets on a network—using network flow (netflow) data | [SEI](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/) | [Paper](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook/blob/master/resources/papers/Network_Profiling_Using_Flow.pdf) |
| Detecting Lateral Movement through Tracking Event Logs |  the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) extracted tools used by many attackers by investigating recently confirmed cases of targeted attacks. Then, a research was conducted to investigate what kind of logs were left on the server and clients by using such tools, and what settings need to be configured to obtain logs that contain sufficient evidential information | [@jpcert](https://twitter.com/jpcert) | [Paper](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/ThreatHunter-Playbook/blob/master/resources/papers/20170612_Detecting_LM.pdf) |
